Hello there!

This project uses Python to analyse the viewing activities of my own account and that of some of my friends and family. 

Python libraries used:
```
- os
- pandas 
- numpy 
- datetime
- seaborn 
- matplotlib 
- pprint
- IPython.display
```

The data was downloaded from www.netflix.com/YourAccount for each individual user profile. This can be achieved by first clicking on 'Download your personal profile', and then clicking 'Submit Request':

Within a few days an email will be recieved which contains multiple files. The CSV required as input for this project is called 'ViewingActivity.CSV'.  The notebook can digest any number of ViewingActivity CSV files automatically, assuming they are all in the same directory which is specified by the user.

All the best,
Rick
